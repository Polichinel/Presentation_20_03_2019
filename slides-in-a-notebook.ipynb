It can be hard to motivate yourself if you don't have a specific reason for going through these torturial, so I would highly recommend you to have you on small project on the side. Whenever you have concluded some torturial(s) see if you can utilize your new skills on your own data.\n",

He also has very nice lectures on youtube https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNJK6_DZvcMqNSzQdEkzvzA. Here uses R but python code pertianing his book can by found on: https://github.com/pymc-devs/resources/tree/master/Rethinking. I can't stress enough how much one can learn from this guy. Not regarding programming, but regarding how to think about your data your models and your problem. Even if you don't use the same tools as him going forward, his outlook on statistics can by applied with great results.\n",

The paper is by no means perfect but it is a nice progressive step away from traditional significans testing and contains reference to a lot of other nice articles.\n",

    "These two course from the economics department is also highly recomendable: \"Social Data Science\" and \"Topics in Solcial Data Science\". The course \"Political Data Science\" at the political Science department is also really good. They use R - but really learnign a bit of R makes a better python user and vica versa. Don't vorry to much about programming langue. As with normal langues learning one makes it much easier to learn one more.\n",
